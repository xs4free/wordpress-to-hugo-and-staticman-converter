# wordpress-to-hugo-and-staticman-converter
Convert a [Wordpress][1] [xml export][2] to [Hugo][3] posts and [Staticman][4] comment-files.

# Credits
Based my code on [wordpress-to-hugo-exporter][5] from [Cyrill Schumacher][6] which is a Wordpress plugin (php) to export posts to Hugo files.
Added staticman comments files based on [Hugo + Staticman: Nested Replies and E-mail Notifications][7] by [Dan C Williams][8].
