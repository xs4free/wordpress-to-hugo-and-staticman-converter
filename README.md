Convert a [Wordpress][https://wordpress.com/] [xml export][https://en.support.wordpress.com/export/] to [Hugo][https://gohugo.io/] posts and [Staticman][https://staticman.net] comment-files.

# Credits
Based my code on [wordpress-to-hugo-exporter][https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter] from [Cyrill Schumacher][https://twitter.com/SchumacherFM] which is a Wordpress plugin (php) to export posts to Hugo files.
Added staticman comments files based on [Hugo + Staticman: Nested Replies and E-mail Notifications][https://networkhobo.com/2017/12/30/hugo---staticman-nested-replies-and-e-mail-notifications/] by [Dan C Williams][http://twitter.com/dancwilliams].
